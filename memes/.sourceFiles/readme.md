Original midi file yoinked from https://onlinesequencer.net/2921017#

Heavily modified and fixed up using http://www.midieditor.org/

Had to reformat into four monophonic tracks, and 1:1 tracks with channels.

CTRE appears to use one channel per motor. Since we have four motors that play music, split into four monophonic channels. 

passerine .exe from https://docs.ctr-electronics.com/cli-tools.html - command line midi->chrp converter from CTRE

Run convert.bat to take the input midi file, export it, and save to the right file in the output folder
